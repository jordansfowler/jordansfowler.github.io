        <p>
          UofSC students are frustrated with not being able to know what food is
          being served before they swipe their meal cards such as in Russell
          House and other dining areas. Especially with their hectic class
          schedules, finding delicious and nutritious meals on a time crunch can
          be a big challenge. Unfortunately, this predicament often causes
          people to waste a meal swipe on food they dislike and waste precious
          minutes on time that could be used elsewhere. Thus, our solution
          should provide a way for users to see what is being served at each
          dining hall everyday.
